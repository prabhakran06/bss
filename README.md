Blind source separation for image and audio
A secure and efficient Blind Source Separation (BSS) based cryptosystem is
presented. The use of BSS in audio and image cryptography in wireless networks has attracted
more attention. A BSS based cryptosystem consists of three main parts: secret data, secret keys,
and mixing matrix. In this paper, we propose a new design to create a proper mixing matrix in a
BSS based cryptosystem. We offer a mathematical criterion to select mixing matrix elements
before encryption. The proposed criterion gives a simple way to attach the secret sources to keys,
which makes source separation very hard for the adversary. Versus, we show that using the
random mixing matrix can lead to data security loss. The attacks used for security tests in this
paper are Differential Attack" and Denoising Atack,'" which are among the most effective in
this field. These attacks will apply to cryptosystems based on the random and the proposed mixing matrix. The visual results of the attacks in the experiments will show that the "proposed
mixing matrix based cryptosystem will be more secure than the *random mixing matrix based
cryptosystem."" We also used the correlation coefficient criterion to compare the two
cryptosystems more accurately. According to the experiments of this paper, the "proposed mixing matrix based cryptosystem vs. the "random mixing matrix based cryptosystem" was
able to reduce the adversary's source extraction quality rate from about 76% to 16%, on average.
